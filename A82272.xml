         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:169776:4"/> purpoſely to puzzle or weary the moſt reſolved <hi>undertakings.</hi> 'Tis true, the manner of delivery uſed by the <hi>Ancients</hi> upon this <hi>Subject,</hi> is very far removed from the common path of <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> yet I beleeve they were conſtrained (for the weight and majeſty of the <hi>Secret)</hi> to invent thoſe occult kinde of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Aenigmaes, Metaphors, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,</hi> and <hi>Figures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now amongſt the Catalogue of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> that have treated of this <hi>ſacred Learning,</hi> I have chiefly obſerved four ſorts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt are ſuch whoſe wel-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honeſty, have cauſed them to lay down the whole Myſtery <hi>faithfully</hi> and <hi>plainly;</hi> giving you a <hi>Clew,</hi> as well as ſhewing you a <hi>Labyrinth;</hi> and they onely are to be ſtudied.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond are thoſe whoſe <hi>Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> handling a part or branch thereof, did it rather to diſcover themſelves <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> then with intent to <hi>inſtruct</hi> others: Theſe may be read, but they are too ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime for thoſe, who ſtand in need of an <hi>Introduction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others there are, who out of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> or <hi>Miſtake,</hi> have delivered blinde
<pb facs="tcp:169776:4"/> and unbottomed <hi>Fictions,</hi> which have too much deluded and abuſed the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>World:</hi> ſo that of this ſort I may ſay (not blemiſhing the honor, which ſome of them have juſtly acquired in other parts of learning,) their <hi>Works</hi> are like <hi>Pigmaleons</hi> Image, [full of exquiſite <hi>proportion, feature, delicacie,</hi> and <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but not animated with the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of <hi>Truth;]</hi> and whileſt a man conſults with <hi>ſuch;</hi> he ſhall always doubt, whether what he reads be to the <hi>matter,</hi> or not: However the <hi>Judicious</hi> may ſmell their levity by the <hi>rankneſs</hi> of their <hi>impertinancies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the laſt and worſt ſort of all, are thoſe, who through <hi>Envy</hi> have ſcattered abroad their unfaithful <hi>recipies</hi> and falſe <hi>gloſſes;</hi> (taking for preſident the <hi>Devil</hi> that can ſow <hi>tares,</hi> and transform himſelf into an <hi>Angel of light)</hi> with intent to <hi>choak</hi> and <hi>obfuſcate</hi> the more evident <hi>light</hi> of the plain dealing <hi>Philoſophers:</hi> And to diſcern theſe <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> requires a Judgment able to divide a Hair.</p>
                  <p>From this variety of <hi>Writers</hi> it is, that many, otherwiſe ſtedy Mindes are toſt up and down, as from Racket to Racket; being forced to change their
<pb facs="tcp:169776:5"/> 
                     <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as oft as they change their <hi>Authors,</hi> and conceiving they have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led right upon a <hi>Point,</hi> (juſt like tickliſh <hi>Weather-cocks,)</hi> are neceſſitated to ſhift with the next <hi>puff,</hi> (although but of an empty windy conceit:) New <hi>diſcoveries</hi> begetting new <hi>opinions,</hi> which raiſe more untoward and turbulent <hi>Doubts,</hi> then their greateſt ſtrength of Judgment can conjure down. Thus <hi>(unhappy men!)</hi> thinking themſelves ready to <hi>Anchor,</hi> a croſs guſt blows them off the <hi>ſhore;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps into a rougher ſea of Debate and Perplexity then before, and with greater hazard and danger of ſplitting.</p>
                  <p>I know that the truth of the proper <hi>Argent,</hi> its <hi>Preparation,</hi> and the <hi>Fire,</hi> (the three moſt important ſteps to this <hi>bleſſed Work)</hi> with the whole <hi>proceſs,</hi> is by ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſo ſincerely laid down and unfolded, that to a knowing <hi>Artiſt</hi> it is a cauſe of much wonder, why he that reads (though but ſmatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly acquainted with <hi>Nature)</hi> ſhould not meet with cleer ſatisfaction: But here's the reaſon, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Haven</hi> towards which many skilful <hi>Pilots</hi> have bent their courſe, yet few have reacht it. For as
<pb facs="tcp:169776:5"/> amongſt the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> there was but one that might enter into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> (and that but once a yeer,) ſo there is ſeldom more in a <hi>Nation,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> lets into this <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> of <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> yet ſome there are. But though the number of thoſe <hi>Elect</hi> are not many, and generally the fathom of moſt mens <hi>Fancies,</hi> that attempt the ſearch of this vaſt and ſubtil <hi>Myſtery,</hi> too narrow to comprehend it, and their ſtrongeſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> too weak to pierce the depth it lies obſcured in; being indeed ſo unſearchable and ambiguous, it rather exacts the ſacred and courteous <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of a <hi>Cherub,</hi> then the weak <hi>aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of a <hi>Pen</hi> to reveal it. Yet let no Man deſpair: <hi>For ſurely there is a ſpirit in man, and the inſpiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty giveth underſtanding;</hi> and though all things before us ſeem hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up in a deformed <hi>Chaos,</hi> yet can he place them in <hi>comlineſs</hi> and <hi>order.</hi> For many <hi>Philoſophers</hi> cloſely ſhut up, or concealed divers things, which they left the ingenious <hi>Inquirer</hi> to ſift into, or finde out; preſuming to whom <hi>God</hi> intended the diſcovery of the <hi>Wonder,</hi> he would afford <hi>Eyes</hi> that ſhould pierce

                  <p>To preſent this invention as more feiſable, we may conſider that the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>radical words,</hi> if numbred, would not ſwell beyond our <hi>Memories</hi> fathom, ſpecially if well ordered and digeſted by the judicious direction of an able and general <hi>Linguiſt;</hi> and ſuch a one that rightly underſtands the firſt and true im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; which <hi>Nature</hi> hath ſtamped upon the <hi>things</hi> they would have ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>Form.</hi> Our miſery now is, we ſpend a great part of our beſt and moſt precious time in learning <hi>one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> to underſtand a <hi>little Matter,</hi> (and in how many <hi>Tongues</hi> is it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be perfect, before a man can be <hi>generally knowing?)</hi> whereas, if this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention

<pb facs="tcp:169776:20"/> in theſe words; <hi>Alexander, art not thou aſhamed to ſing ſo finely?</hi> By which words he accounts it diſhonorable for a Noble Man to uſe that Art publikely; but rather when he is at leiſure: Privately, either to refreſh his Spirits, or if there be any diſpute concerning Phyſick, that it ſhould be temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all Harmonical ſweetneſs, and proportion. In like manner it is (to our grief be it ſpoken) with the Art of Chymiſtry, whileſt it is ſo much defamed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged, and brought into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, by the fraudulent dealings of Impoſtors, as that whoſoever profeſſes it, ſhall ſtill be ſtigmatized with Publike Reproach.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs very many, yea, too many there are to be found at this day, (profeſſing I know not what ſhadow, of this Divine Art) who ingroſs unto themſelves, as it were the whole World, to its
<pb facs="tcp:169776:20"/> Deſtruction, [Braſs, Iron, or other Metal,] not to convert the ſame into Gold, but are found at length to cheat with it for Gold, to the great grief of many: Orphans mourn, by reaſon of ſuch Knaves, Widows weep, Husbands lament, Wives bewail their miſery. This Man deſireth his Lands, that his Houſe, another his Rents taken from him. And amongſt theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (which is the more to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at) we have known very many inſtructed in every Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Science; becauſe of whom (being ſtruck no leſs with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then Fear,) I begun to be ſomething diſcouraged, and by the example of their vain Expence, gave over any further ſcrutiny in this Golden Science.</p>
                  <p>But the remembrance of my Infancy in this Study, wherein for ſeven yeers together I had been an eye witneſs of the Truth thereof,

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ven as Reaſon and Experience, are juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Hands of <hi>Phyſitians;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, neither Health [the Treaſure of Life] can be preſerved; nor Sickneſs [the Herauld of Death] expelled: And that Phyſick it ſelf remaineth Lame and Defective: So, in this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Work, Nature and Art ought ſo lovingly to embrace each other, as that Art may not require what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture denies, nor Nature deny what may be perfected by Art. For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſſenting, ſhe demeans her ſelf obediently to every Artiſt, whileſt by their Induſtry ſhe is helped, not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Of whoſe Steps, Progreſs, Motion, and Condition, whoſoever
<pb facs="tcp:169776:23"/> is ignorant, let him not preſume to attempt this Work, (of it ſelf Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, and otherwiſe wonderfully ſhadowed over by Philoſophers, with infinite Clouds:) For nothing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers his Expectation, who either knows not, or ſtrives to compel Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For that ſhe (as learnedly <hi>Raymund)</hi> will not be enforced, or ſtraitned. But he that covets after Fame, by the Honor of the Art, or to reach the Summity thereof; let him firſt obſerve, and obſequiouſly follow Nature Naturalizing, Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating, Multiplying, and being the Miſtreſs and Guide, muſt reſemble Art in what ſhe is able: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in divers things it be a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectrix, and help of Nature, whilſt it cleanſeth her from all Errors and Defilements, and being hindred in Motion, is holpen by it; yet is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible ſhe ſhould be imitated in all things.</p>
                  <p>For, as in this Divine Work (not
<pb facs="tcp:169776:24"/> undeſervedly ſo called, inaſmuch as it is affirmed of all Philoſophers, that never any Man of himſelf, without Divine Inſpiration, could compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, or underſtand it, though otherwiſe he appeared a moſt Learned Philoſopher:) So, in all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Bodies, in the firſt Mixture, or Compoſition of Elements (that I may conceal the Occult cauſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conjunction) the weight and proportion of every Element, are utterly unknown. That Secret of Secrets, beſtowed by God upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Beginning, ſhe ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in her own Power, and ſhall ſo, until the end of the World: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, leſt Mortal Men (if it had been made known to them) elated by the inſolence and pride of Devils, ſhould preſume to Create, which is proper to God onely; who by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Power of his Word, hath endued Nature (as his Miniſter) with the Generation, Propagation,
<pb facs="tcp:169776:24"/> and Multiplication of all things. For when he inſpired in things Created, the Generation of the World (ſaying, <hi>Encreaſe and Multiply;)</hi> he gave alſo a certain Springing or Budding, [that is, Greenneſs, or Strength,] whereby all things mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply themſelves (whence ſome more profoundly contemplating, ſaid, That all things were green; whereas to be green, may be ſaid to encreaſe, and grow up together,) and that Greenneſs they called Nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not without cauſe, that the prime Philoſophers do ſo ſeek after, and ſacrifice to Nature: when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her help, Art (in this knowledg) performs nothing. Nor any wonder, if the moſt Learned Engliſh Monk, <hi>[Roger Bacon,]</hi> writ of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Power of Nature, and the marvellous Secrets in Art. Nor doth <hi>Parmenides</hi> leſs admire the Power of Nature, [in theſe words, <hi>O that Heavenly Nature, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling,</hi>

                     <hi>and excelling the Natures of Truth, and cauſing them to rejoyce. This is that ſpecial and Spiritual Nature, to whom God gave a Power, above the violence of Fire; and therefore let us mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it, ſeeing that nothing is more Pretious!]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>(Friendly Reader)</hi> I recommend to thee, and the Sons of Art, this Lady of Honor, without which we attain not, (or perfect any thing in) this Art; that ſo it may be your work, and chief ſtudy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Friendſhip, ſo, as when an occaſion ſerves, ye may be found Judges, not Jugglers of Nature and Art.</p>

                     <p> The Philoſophers Gold and <note place="margin">Dunſtan.</note> Silver, are two principall Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, red and white, buried in one &amp; the ſame body, which Tinctures can never naturally come to their perfect complement, yet they are ſeparable from accidentall droſſe, and earthly lutoſity, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by their proper qualities in their pure Earths the tinctures red and white are found commixtable, and the moſt fit Ferments for them, ſo that they may in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be ſaid to want no other thing. Of this very Body the matter of the Stone, three things are chiefly ſpoken, viz. <hi>The green Lion, Aſſa foetida, and white Fume;</hi> but this is inferred by the Philoſophers from the Compound, that they might anſwer the fooliſh according to their own folly, and deceive them by the divers multiplicity of names. But doe thou always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand one thing to be really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169776:31"/> although accidentally three things may be ſo called. For the green Lyon, Aſſa foetida, and white Fume, are altogether attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to one and the ſame ſubject, and are always coucht in one and the ſame ſubject, untill by Art made manifeſt.

By Aſſa foetida, we underſtand a certain unſavory O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, exhaled from the unclean bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the firſt operation, which may in all things be likened to ſtinking Aſſa foetida. The reaſon why it is called white Fume is this: In the firſt diſtillation, before the Red Tincture aſcends, there ariſes a ſmoak truly white, whereby the

                     <p>The Spirit is a ſecond Water of <note place="margin">Scala.</note> which all the things forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are nouriſhed, every plant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſht and quickned, every light kindled, and it makes and cauſes all Fruit.

                     <p>We calcine perfect Bodies with <note place="margin">Ripleus.</note> the firſt Fire naturally, but no unclean Body doth ingredience our work except one, which of the Philoſophers is called the Green Lion, which is the medium of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and joining Tinctures. <hi>Ripl. pa.</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain Soul exiſting between Heaven and Earth, ariſing from the Earth, as Aire with pure Water, the cauſe of the life of all living things, continually running down upon our fourfold Nature producing her with all its power to a better condition, which airy Soul is the ſecret Fire of our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, otherwiſe called our Oil, and myſtically our Water. <hi>Idem pa. eadem.</hi>

                     <p>This Fire is called Humour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Vogel.</note> in it, as hath been ſaid, heat or the fire of Nature is hidden, even as the heat of Animals, in the Primogenian moiſture.</p>

                     <p> We therefore call it Innaturall <note place="margin">Lullius.</note> or not Naturall, becauſe it is not naturated of it ſelf, nor takes away any thing from naturated Nature, nay it rather helps her, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of a moderate Exerciſe, according to what Nature requires in her Reformations. <hi>Lullius Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. pa.</hi> 24.</p>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169776:64"/> of Subtilty it is called Spirit, without which Spirit there can neither be made Generation, nor Conjunction of the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

If therefore in the time of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul ſhall ſtand in the Fire, and his ſtrength prevail, through the force of the Spirit, then ſhe flies from the Fire, and draws with her the Body to flight, and the Workman remains fruſtrate of his purpoſe, and expects that which hath been already come and gone, and will never come hereafter, and it ſeems wonderfull to him: But if the ſtrength of the Body prevail above the ſtrength of the Soul, then by equality of Spirit it is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169776:65"/> from Act into Habit, then the Body retains the Soul altogether, nor ever hath the power to fly from the Fire; and the Workman hath his purpoſe, which the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients had, and then the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains always with them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Act, and ſometimes in Habit. But a quick and double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight is altogether neceſſary, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally both in the end of Decoction, and Sublimation, that all the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities being whitened, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt may ſee the wonderfull and terrible Candor, and may preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain his joyfull and quiet reſt, after this Conſummation of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for then by infrigidating the Moon, the Sun is hidden in her Bowels, and the Eaſt is joined to the Weſt, Heaven to Earth, and Spirituall to Corporall, whence is ſaid in <hi>Turba,</hi> Know ye that ye ſhall not Die the purple Colour, but in Cold.

                        <p>Leſt perhaps <hi>Ripley</hi> and <hi>Daſtin</hi> our Countrimen, and moſt excellent Philoſophers, ſhould in this Chapter ſeem to ſome, to differ among themſelves: ſince <hi>Ripley</hi> takes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall parts, and joins them in equall Wedlock; but <hi>Daſtin</hi> affirms the Water ought nine times to exceed the Earth, that ſo in a Decinary, which is a perfect Number, the whole Work might be conſummate: I thought it worth my labour to reconcile this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing contradiction. As therefore he that well diſtinguiſhes, teaches well; ſo he that knows this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time, ſhall forthwith have the Solution of this doubt.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>Ripley</hi> firſt ſpeaks of the firſt Compoſition in the ſecond or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick Work, where the Earth and pure Water prepared exactly before muſt be equally joined in equall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169776:73"/> But <hi>Daſtin</hi> utters that his Opinion of Imbibitions, after the perfection of the ſecond Work; and ſo while they are diſtinguiſht, they are underſtood, and that eaſily. But what means <hi>Ripley</hi> in theſe words, viz. <hi>That they ſhould lie together ſix Weeks, not riſing all the while from the bottome of their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre?</hi> this muſt be enquired and ſearched into, ſince he affirms it a ſecret which hath deceived many. That Conjunction is done, that even as a Chicken is made of an Egge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Putrefaction, ſo after this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and due Putrefaction, we may attain the Complement of the Work.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we muſt know, if any thing may be born by Putrefaction, it is neceſſary it happen after this manner. The Earth by a certain hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and included humidity, is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a certain corruption or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which is the beginning
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169776:74"/> of Putrefaction, which ought to be nouriſht with ſuch a tempered heat, as that nothing exhale from the Compound, or be ſublimed to the top of the Veſſel; but that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculine and Feminine, the Matter and the Form, Agent and Patient, remain together. The Water in the Earth, and the Earth unſeparated from the Water, are contained toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the yolk of an Egge, included in the inner thin skin, till the time of Putrefaction looſe the reins, which will not be done ſooner then in the ſpace of forty days; for as Nature hates ſudden mutations or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo no Putrefaction is made but in a long time, and appointed, as <hi>Daſtin</hi> elegantly ſaid, <hi>viz. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the Aire, ſubtility of the Matter, gentleneſſe of the Fire ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Reſt, equality of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, gravity of Patience, and the maturity of Time, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and induce Putrefaction, and</hi>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:169776:74"/> 
                           <hi>therefore then alſo the Air is to be tempered, the Thick ſubtilized, the Fire reſtrained, Reſt preſerved, Proportion adequated, Patience ſtrengthened, and the Time expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, till Nature proceeding natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſhal compleat her own Work.</hi>

                        <p>But that I may return to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and adde Corollary to Corollary; we muſt obſerve that in Preparation, three parts of the Spirit are aſſumed to one part of the imperfect Body, and at laſt about the time of the Birth three parts of imperfect Body are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to one of Spirit, and this not once, but often. But in the ſecond Work, which of Philoſophers is called the firſt; firſt, part is joined with part, afterward three parts of Body to one of Spirit, and that the oftner for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibitions, and at length three of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to one part of perfect Body for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration or fermentation, by which is performed our Myſtical, Divine, and more then perfect Work numberleſly

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169776:81"/> parts, the beginning of the end, and the end of the beginning; for what pity were it an Heire from the Kingly Stock ſhould be born, and none found that knew how to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it? Therefore to nouriſh this our Infant we adviſe with Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that (ſince he is of the Royall Stock, and the moſt pure conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he might not be delivered to any ſtrange Nurſe, but might ſuck the Breſts of his Mother, who as ſhe had before nouriſht him in the Womb with her own Blood; ſo being now come to Maturity, he is to be nouriſht, and in a due proportion fed with the exuberated Blood, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated and rectified through the Mamillary veins. And the medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meaſure of that Milk, let it be weekly the fourth part of the weight of the Infant; But let him keep this Diet for ſeaven Weeks, till he be ſo Medicinally fed that while in a glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Lodge (ordained and firmly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerated
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169776:82"/> by Phyſicians and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers) he be placed and repoſed in a Bath, and being lulled aſleep, his limbs diſſolve and melt with ſweat, which by the help of Art and Nature, and due governance, ſhall reſume their former ſhape, renued, and their ſtrength ſo multiplied, that now he deſires Kingly food, with which nouriſhment in a ſhort ſpace he will become a King, ſtronger then a King, and ſo ſtout in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that he alone being a moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Conqueror, will obtain the Victory againſt ten thouſand Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Therefore ſeek this King, whom who ſo hath for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſhall command all Sublunary things.</p>

                     <p>BY the Teſtimony of all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers <note place="margin">Taulada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> there are three parts of the <hi>Elixir, viz.</hi> Soul, Body, and Spirit; The Soul is onely the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Form of the Elixir, the Body is the Paſte or Matter, which two parts are to be drawn from Metals only; to wit, the Form from the Sun and Moon, the Matter from Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, and Mars, as alſo <hi>Lullius</hi> affirms. But the third part of the Stone is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which ſince it is the Seat and Chariot of the Soul, it doth pour the Soul into the Body, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds and joins theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes with an indiſſoluble bond of agreement, which Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor being removed, the Soul can never enter league with the Body. For two extremes agree not well,

This Spirit it nothing elſe then that liquor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating the Form and Matter of the Stone, and reducing it to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Nature, which Spirit is ſometimes called of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Heaven, ſometimes ſolutive Mercury, ſometimes menſtruous Matter, ſometimes Quinteſſence, and infinite other names. <hi>Tauladan. pa.</hi> 338.</p>

                     <p>They who knew not Natures <note place="margin">Lullius.</note> indigency, thought this Ferment ought to be prepared with new menſtrous Matter, in which is Fire againſt Nature, not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the perdition of the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature from which the Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, by reaſon of the burning Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt Nature.

                     <p>Take one part of Ferment, and <note place="margin">Roſar.</note> three of imperfect Body, diſſolve the Ferment in Water of Mercury equall to it, boil it together with a moſt gentle Fire, and coagulate that Ferment, that it may be as an imperfect Body. <hi>Roſar.

                     <p>In the preparation of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Lullius.</note> before its laſt Fermentation we uſe vulgar Mercury, not onely ſolemnly prepared, <hi>viz.</hi> into Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Milk, but as it exiſts in its Nature, by the alone Sublimation to this, that it might reduce the Body of Ferment to its ſimplicity, and it may be the mean of conjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                     <p>As the Ferment of Gold is <note place="margin">Tauladanus</note> Gold; of Silver, is Silver; ſo the Ferment of Iron, is Iron, of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is Copper, and of Lead, is Lead. Therefore every Agent acts according to its form. To ſome, what we have ſpoken may ſeem new; as if the Elixir could be made of all ignoble things, which ſhall turn all other things as well noble as ignoble, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mars, or Jupiter, or Saturn, or Venus. Which although it now ſeem new and incredible to many learned men, and chiefly to <hi>Petrus Bonus,</hi> a man of ſingular learning;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169776:85"/> yet there is no neceſſary reaſon, which forbids it may be done. Nay if it were not done, Alchymy had been loſt, and the Art of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry might have been worthily called a Figment and a Fable. For Nature hath eſtabliſhed this Law, <hi>viz.</hi> That as often as Actives are rigbtly joined with Paſſives Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Paſſion doe immediately follow, and the alteration doth always reſent and ſavour of the nature of the Agent. And as often as that which before had the ſtrength and qualities of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, be ſo diſpoſed that it can ſtoutly act, it is neceſſary that the alteration be anſwerable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Nature of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent from which it ſuffered. Wherefore if ignoble Metals diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſuffer or change by the action of Gold or Silver, rightly diſpoſed to Action, it is neceſſary that noble Metals diſpoſed to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169776:86"/> ſhould be changed by ignoble Metals, skilfully diſpoſed to Act. <hi>Tauladanus pa.</hi> 297.</p>
                     <p>Let the Ferment be prepared, <note place="margin">Clangor Bucc.</note> that the powder may be white and ſubtill, if thy intention proceed to white; but if to red, then let thy powder be of Gold prepared moſt Citrine; and there ſhall not be other Ferment: the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe two Bodies are ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in which are tingent ſplendid Raies, excelling other Bodies na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in whiteneſſe and redneſſe. And if thou wouldſt ferment white Earth, divide that Earth into two parts, one part thou ſhalt augment to a white Elixir, with its conſerved Water, (and ſo it never ceaſes to be of it) and the other part put into its Glaſſe, that is, the Furnace of its Digeſtion, and increaſe the Fire to it, untill by the force of the Fire, it be turned into moſt red Duſt, even as dry
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169776:86"/> combuſt Saffron. And if thou wouldſt that the moſt white Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xir have the Tincture of Redneſſe, transforming and tincting Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, the Moon and every Body into the moſt true Sun, or Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficous Body; then ferment its three parts with another part and a half of moſt pure prepared Gold, and let the powder be moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile with two parts of Solificous Water artificially reducing by Union by the leaſt parts into one Chaos even unto the inmoſt part of the Body, and place it in its Glaſſe in his Fire, and decoct it, that the moſt true bloody red Stone might ſhine forth. <hi>Clang. Bucc. p.</hi> 529.</p>
                     <p>There is no other Ferment but <note place="margin">Lullius.</note> of the Sun or Moon. And it is not Ferment untill the ſaid Bodies be turned into their firſt Matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is expedient, that Ferment be compounded of the Sun, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169776:87"/> the moſt ſubtile Earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou knoweſt not how to reduce two perfect Bodies into their firſt Matter, thou canſt have no Ferment. <hi>Lull. Theor. p.</hi> 92.</p>
                     <p>For this is Minerall, that when <note place="margin">Maſſa Solis &amp; Lunae.</note> thou putſt Water on the Earth, the White overcomes the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Red; and whitens them into whiteneſſe of Silver. Then the Citrine overcomes the White and Red, ſo that it makes them Citrine, above the Citrinity of Gold, and then the Red over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Citrine and White, and reddens them into a Tyrian red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and when thou ſeeſt theſe, rejoice. <hi>Maſſa Solis &amp; Lunae. pa.</hi> 212.</p>

                        <p>As in this Chapter is clearly and plainly taught the excellent manner of Fermentation, ſo to the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Reader, this contradiction may appear, between <hi>Raimund</hi> and <hi>Ripley</hi> in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt <hi>Raimund</hi> affirms two Ferments onely, one of the Sun, another of the Moon; but <hi>Ripley</hi> addes a third, which is called the Green Lion, and the unclean Body, which is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Laton, which Laton ſince indeed is no other thing then an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect compound Body of Gold and Silver according to <hi>Morienus;</hi> that third of <hi>Ripley</hi> is clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be no other thing then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature Gold and Silver; and ſo they doe not differ but agree in matter of Ferment, though for immaturities ſake it be ſignified by another name. To this our <hi>Dunſtan</hi> Archbiſhop of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169776:88"/> 
                           <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſeems to aſſent. It is certain the Earth may be the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Water, ſo it be fixt, and the Water the Ferment of the Earth, if contrariwiſe it be perfect and pure, and this altogether without all help of Vulgar Gold and Silver. Which words doe ſeem indeed to bring a new controverſie amongſt their opinions, while ſome affirm the Elixir cannot be made without Vulgar Gold and Silver. Again, others affirm that Vulgar Gold and Silver is nothing uſefull in our Work: Let therefore <hi>Dunſtans</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion intercede. <hi>We muſt note</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did not uſe Vulgar Gold and Silver in this Work, and therefore they ſaid their labour needed no great Coſt, but might equally be performed as well of the Poor as of the Rich, the Countriman as Citizen; which would altogether differ from truth, if it might not</hi>
                           <pb n="123" facs="tcp:169776:88"/> 
                           <hi>be performed without Vulgar Gold and Silver.</hi> He thus taught therefore that we ſhould take heed: For although Gold and Silver may be ſubtilized and mingled with Tinctures, and be reduced to leſſer Elixirs; yet the way according to the Doctrine of the Philoſophers, is not in them; For their Gold and Silver are two chief Tinctures, Red and White buried in one and the ſame Body, which by Nature never attained their perfect Complement, yet they are ſeparable from their Earthly Lutoſity, and accidentall Droſſe, and then by their proper qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſo commixtible with Earths pure Red and White, and are found ſo fit Ferments for them, that they may no way be ſaid to need any other thing. In which words is deſcribed no other thing then <hi>Ripleys</hi> green Lion, or their Gold, not Gold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in poſsibility while as yet imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Which always and onely is ſet
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169776:89"/> apart and choſen of all Philoſophers, and thoſe that underſtand, for their firſt Matter. Whence it is clearly manifeſt that neither Vulgar Gold nor Silver ought to be taken for the firſt Matter, but yet it is doubtfull. If, why, and when they are neceſſary for us, to the Compoſition of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir. To which I anſwer from the authority of the Philoſophers, That they are ſo neceſſary, as without them the Elixir cannot be perfected. But yet not as they are Vulgar Gold and Silver, but being ſo altered as that they may be reduced to their firſt Matter, and while they are fixt by Nature, may be made Volatile by Art, and then at length while they are in ſuch a Condition, it ſhall be impoſsible for any Artiſt to reduce them again to Vulgar Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, after the manner of Goldſmiths; becauſe then according to the <hi>Turba</hi> the Body becomes incorporate, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Roſarius</hi> witneſſeth. <hi>He that</hi>
                           <pb n="125" facs="tcp:169776:89"/> 
                           <hi>knows ſo to deſtroy Gold, that it be no more Gold, has attained the greateſt ſecret. And when it is ſo prepared, then it ſhall be the firſt proper Diſh, of which our Infant is nouriſht, and by Philoſophers ſhall have the name of Ferment. Which, after the Stone be come to its perfect Redneſſe, and hath been nouriſht with the Mothers Milk, it ought to be joined with its red Earth for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Elixir, that it might render a more then perfect Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and might communicate its fixt Nature, to the prepared Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which being ſpecificated it might at length become perfect.</hi> Therefore hence it appears, That why, and when Vulgar Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are not neceſſary to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Work. That therefore I may briefly reduce to one Harmony this appearing Controverſie (which the Philoſophers underſtanding one
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169776:90"/> another mutually, deliver purpoſely in intricate terms) in theſe words of <hi>Guido Montanus,</hi> viz. <hi>Although the Philoſophers Stone may be made even to Whiteneſſe and Redneſſe without Vulgar Gold or Silver, yet the Elixir cannot be made without Vulgar Gold or Silver, altered and prepared as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> But that I may conclude this Corollary, always obſerve, that after the Work of Winter is performed, and thou ſhalt ſee the Sun exalted in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that then the Philoſophick Work be begun, That in that very houre we ought to prepare Ferments, becauſe they need long Preparation, and it would be the greateſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, that when the King ſhould hunger, food ſhould be wanting, or that there ſhould not be a Diſh of Dainties prepared. Therefore let every Artiſt be provident.</p>

See therefore thou firſt Project thy Medicine on Ferment, then that Ferment will be brittle as Glaſſe;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169776:91"/> then caſt that brittle Subſtance upon Bodies clean and very pure, and preſently thou ſhalt ſee them curiouſly coloured with Tincture which will abide all Trials.

                     <p>But the manner of Projection <note place="margin">Avicenna.</note> is, that thou Project one part of the foreſaid Medicine upon a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred parts of fuſed or powred Gold, and it makes it frangible, and the whole will be a Medicine of which one part Projected upon a hundred of any fuſed Metall turns it into the beſt Gold.

                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:169776:92"/> how many parts, one part can turn into Metall; and by this manner thou ſhalt neceſſarily finde the end of Projection, otherwiſe thou ſhalt never finde it, unleſſe it be firſt converted into a hard fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Maſſe, as we told thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Lull.

                     <p>But this is the greateſt Secret, <note place="margin">Ventura.</note> that the vertue of the Medicine ſhall be alſo augmented in the Projection, not onely in extenſive Quantity, but alſo in the vertue of Perfection and Goodneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Medicine be Projected in a due Proportion upon a Body, and the whole be put into Fire, and augmented by its degrees, and be oftner diſſolved, and oftner coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, till it be more fluxill then Wax. Wherefore if in Projection the Medicinebe ſo much weakned that it cannot have ingreſſe any longer, ingreſſe is given to it if part of the firſt Medicine be joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169776:92"/> to it, and it be decocted by diſſolving and coagulating till it flow. But by how much leſſe the vertue of the Medicine is, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily convenient to adminiſter the Fire from the beginning, and according to the degrees of Time, by ſo much the more temperature. But if there ſhall nothing remain of the firſt and moſt perfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which might be added, (which leſt it happen to him, the ingenious Artiſt muſt chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware) thence it will be fit to doe otherwiſe. The third manner is (according to <hi>Roſarius)</hi> that a little part of the Medicine, whether white or red, be joined with the Stone or our Mercury, (which was never in the Work) and let it be put to digeſtion as before, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted by Putrefying, Subliming, and Fixing, untill the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a tinctured Oil, then again thou ſhalt have the perfect Stone;

                     <p>The Augmentation in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">Clangor.</note> and Quality, is to diſſolve and coagulate the very Tincture, that is, to imbibe and exſiccate it in our Mercury. Or thus, take
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169776:96"/> one part of the prepared Tincture, and diſſolve it in three parts of our Mercury, then put it in a Veſſell, and ſeal the Veſſell, and cover it with hot Embers, till it be exſiccated and become Duſt, then open the Veſſel, and again imbibe and exſiccate as before, and how much the oftner thou doſt this, ſo often ſhalt thou gain ſome parts. Or elſe take of the fixt Matter which tincteth, that is, of the prepared Tincture three parts, and of the Philoſophers Mercury one part, and put it into a Veſſel, and ſeal the Veſſel, and put it among hot Embers as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and exſiccate it, that it may be made Duſt, then open the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, imbibe, and exſiccate it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And the Water that is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent vive or Mercury, addes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Weight, or to the Body, unleſſe as much as remains of the Metallick humidity.</p>

                     <p> Alſo Multiplication in Quantity is made by mixtion of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine with vulgar Argent vive in a Crucible, which Argent vive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is turned into red Duſt by admixtion of the Stone, and again, that, of that Argent vive which ſhould be caſt upon other Argent vive, is again alſo turned into Duſt, and ſo thou ſhalt make reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Duſt of Argent vive upon other Argent vive, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Argent vive cannot be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Duſt, but remain turned into a perfect Metall. <hi>Clangor Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinae pa.</hi> 533.</p>
                     <p>If thou wouldſt multiply it, it <note place="margin">Artepheus.</note> is fit thou diſſolve the red again, in a new diſſolutive Water, and in an iterated decoction to whiten and redden it by the degrees of Fire, by reiterating the firſt Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Work.

                     <p n="1">1. THE Materiall Part being known, and had, it ought not to be kept in a Hot, and Moiſt, but in a Cold or Dry place; nor be kept long: but thou beginneſt to Work with it whilſt it is freſh, and but newly Extracted from its Mine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Begin not to Work, unleſſe thou haſt ſo much of the Proper Materiall weighed out, as will ſerve for two years; that in caſe thou faileſt the firſt time, thou maiſt correct it the ſecond. Becauſe thou canſt not examine Truth without Falſhood; nor that which is Streight without conſideration had of that which is Crooked. So that if thou ſhouldſt want Matter to work upon, thou leaveſt the Work unfiniſhed,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169776:99"/> and getteſt nothing but thy Labour for thy Pains.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Elements are to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in a ſoft Bath, that the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick be not perceived to be hot, but that the vapour (being Elevated and Congealed in the Colder Aire) may be turned into Water, having the form of all the Species's where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is Generated.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. After the Water ſhall be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, let it not ſtand long when it is fit for Operation; Becauſe the Coagulum thereof falleth into the bottome, congealing the Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (Body) by the Coldneſſe and Drineſſe of the Aire: <hi>which</hi> (ſaith <hi>Senior) happened to one of my Aſſociates, who found it ſo for a whole year, but not Diſtilled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is neceſſary the Artiſt have a great Quantity of Water, becauſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169776:100"/> that in the Beginning, Middle, and End, there will always be a neceſsity thereof, as well in Putrefying, Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Calcining, Subliming, Imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, as that the Elixir may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Reſolved. Wherefore <hi>Avicen</hi> in his Epiſtle to his Son, <hi>My Son it behoveth thee to have a great Quantity of our Sun and Moon, that thou maiſt extract their Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, ſixty Pounds at the leaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thou maiſt with on Pound weight of Water, reſolve the Matter into Water, even to an Infinite Quantity. But he that deſires to gather this firſt Pound let him be Patient, and proceed ſoftly and ſweetly, not haſtily: For that Work is termed of Philoſophers, <hi>An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of his own Sweat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. But above all, thou muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that at no time thou putteſt a cold Glaſſe into the hot Water;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169776:100"/> leſt it ſhould be broke, and thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thy Labour.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. It is to be noted, When thou takeſt up a Veſſel, thou ſuffereſt it to coole with Water, for the ſpace of three hours, at the leaſt.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Take heed in Diſtillation, that the Water bubble not at the ſame time.</p>

                     <p n="14">14. To the Building of a Kings Palace, theſe following Artificers are neceſſarily required, A Maſon, a Smith, a Glaſier, a Potter, (or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Earthen Images) a Carpenter; without which, neither the Palace can rightly be built; nor the King

                     <p n="16">16. He that would underſtand the ſayings of Philoſophers, muſt not give credit ſo much to their Words, as to the things they Treat of: For, the knowledge of Words, is not to be taken from the manner of ſpeaking; becauſe that the Matter is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Speech, but the Speech to the Matter.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Note, that a ſhort and broad veſſell is requiſite for diſtilling a Heavy Body, or at leaſt Water with its Saltneſſe. Becauſe that by how much the Water is more Ponderous then the Body, by ſo much ought the Veſſell to be the broader and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, through which the heat paſſeth more temperate and profitable to the Work.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Great care is always to be had, leſt at any time from the firſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169776:102"/> Conjunction to the Whiteneſſe, the Matter ſhould wax cold; or be at any time moved by reaſon of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Danger.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Let not a greater Quantity of the Matter be put into the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Egge, then may fill two Thirds thereof, at the utmoſt.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. It is to be noted, that in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or Calcination of the Earth, although the Waters Imbibition, or Exſiccation, be made in Preparation by the temperate heat of the Bath; yet its Sublimation or Riſing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a ſwift fire of Aſhes.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. The Philoſophicall Work may be begun with an equall Proportion of Earth prepared, and pure Water ſeven times rectified; which are joined and put up in an Ovall Glaſſe Hermetically Sealed. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let them be placed in the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169776:103"/> Furnace, or Athanore, and cheriſhed with a moſt ſoft Fire, whilſt the Earth drinks up her Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and (according to <hi>Ripley)</hi> the Streams are dried up. Then laſtly, let the dry Matter be comforted with ſeven Imbibitions, and every Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibition keep the following Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſo the Water may be a juſt Meaſure exceed the Earth nine times according to the Doctrine of Philoſophers; which cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be done, then by obſerving theſe Numbers. But this ſecret was never as yet Revealed by any Body.</p>
                     <p>For Example: If in the firſt Conjunction the Earth weigh 480 Grains, then let ſo many be added to it of its Water, which together make up 960 Grains, and for the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the firſt Imbibition 240 Grains of new Water are required, 300 to the ſecond, 375 to the third, 468 to the fourth, 585 to the fifth,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the heights of hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Philoſophy, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Hermetick Stone hath of a long time been ſtrongly believed to be the chiefeſt, and neareſt a Miracle, both for the Labyrinths and multitudes of operations, out of which the minde of man, unleſſe it be illuminated by a beam of Divine light, is not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde her ſelf; as alſo becauſe of its moſt noble end which promiſeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant plenty of health and fortunes, the two main pillars of an happie life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the chief Promoters of this Science have made it moſt remote from the knowledge of the vulgar ſort by their Tropes and dark expreſſions, and have placed it on high, as a Tower impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Rocks and Situation, whereunto there can be no acceſſe, unleſſe God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169776:106"/> the way. The ſtudy of hiding this Art hath drawn a reproach upon the Art it ſelf and its Profeſſors: for when thoſe unfortunate Plunderers of the Golden Fleece by reaſon of their unskilfulneſſe felt themſelves, beat down from their vain attempt, and far unequall unto ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons; they in a furious rapture of deſperation, like mad-men, waxed hot againſt their fame and the renown of the Science, utterly denying any thing to be above their cognizance and the ſpheare of their wit, but what was fooliſh and frothy: And becauſe they ſet upon a buſineſſe of damage to themſelves, they have not ceaſed to accuſe the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of hidden Philoſophy of falſhood, Nature of impotency, and Art of cheats, not for any other reaſon, then that they raſhly condemne what they know not: nor is this condemnation a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, without the addition of madneſs to ſnarl and bite the innocent with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſlaunders. I grieve (in truth) for their hard fortune, who whileſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove others, give occaſion of their own conviction, although they juſtly ſuffer an helliſh fury within them. They moil and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169776:106"/> ſweat to batter the obſcure principles of the moſt hidden Philoſophy with troops of arguments, and to pull up the ſecret foundations thereof with their deviſed engines: which yet are onely manifeſt to the skilfull, and thoſe that are much verſed in ſo ſublime Philoſophy, but hid from ſtrangers: Nor doe theſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Cenſors obſerve, that whilſt they malign anothers credit, they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly betray their own. Let them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with themſelves, whether they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe things which they carp at; What Author of eminency hath divulged the ſecret elements of this Science, the Labyrinths and windings of operations, and laſtly, the whole proceedings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? What <hi>Oedipus</hi> hath ſincerely and truly explained unto him the figures and intangled dark ſpeeches of Authors? With what Oracle, what Sibyll, have they been led into the Sanctuary of this holy Science? In fine, how were all things in it made ſo manifeſt, that no part remains yet unveiled? I ſuppoſe they will no otherwiſe anſwer my queſtion, then thus, that they have pierced all things by the ſubtilty of their wits; or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169776:107"/> confeſſe that they were taught (or rather ſeduced) by ſome wandring Quack or Mountebank, who hath crept into a good eſteem with them, by his feigned countenance of a Philoſopher. O wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe! who can ſilently ſuffer theſe Palmer-worms to gnaw upon the fame, labour, and glory of the wiſe? who can with patience hear blinde men, as out of a Tripode judging of the Sun? But it is greater glory to contemne the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe darts of bablers, then to repell them. Let them onely diſdain the treaſure of Nature and Art, who cannot obtain it. Nor is it my purpoſe to plead the doubtfull cauſe of an unfortunate Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and being condemned, to take it into tuition: Our guiltleſſe Philoſophy is no whit criminous: and ſtanding firm by the aid of eminenteſt Authors, and fortified with the manifold experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of divers ages, it remains ſafe enough from the fopperies of pratlers, and the ſnarlings of envy. However Charity hath incited me, and the multitude of wanderers induced me, taking pity on them, to preſent my light, that ſo they may eſcape the hazard of the night: by
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169776:107"/> help whereof they may not onely live out, but alſo procure an enlargement both to their Life and fading Fortunes. This ſmall Treatiſe penn'd for your uſe (ye Students of Hermetick Philoſophy) I preſent unto you, that it may be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to thoſe, for whoſe ſake it was writ. If any perhaps ſhall complain of me, and ſummon me to appear as guilty of breach of ſilence for divulging ſecrets in an itching ſtyle, ye have one guilty of too much reſpectfulneſſe towards you, confeſſing his fault, ſentence him if you pleaſe; ſo that my crime may ſupply the place of a reward to you: The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will not bee diſpleaſing unto you, and the puniſhment (I doubt not) plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant unto mee, if I ſhall finde my ſelf to have erred in this onely, whereby you may put an end to erring for the future.</p>

Let him that is deſirous of this Knowledge, clear his minde from all evil motions, eſpecially pride, which is abomination to Heaven, and the gate of Hell: let him be frequent in prayers, and charitable; have little to do with the world; abſtain from company keeping; enjoy conſtant tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; that the Minde may be able to reaſon more freely in private, and be higher lifted up; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be kindled with a beam of Divine Light, it will not be able to penetrate the hidden myſteries of Truth.</p>

                     <p n="10">10.

To theſe two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes let him adde both his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticks, out of which Works all things deſirable may be collected, eſpecially the truth of Matter, the degrees of Fire, and the ordering of the Whole, wherein the whole Work is finiſhed, and thoſe things which our Anceſtors too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laboured to keep ſecret. The occult cauſes of things, and the ſecret motions of nature, are demonſtrated more clearly and faithfully. Concerning the firſt and myſticall Water of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers he hath ſet down few things, yet very pithy.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. As for that clear Water ſought for by many, found out by few, yet obvious and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto all, which is the Baſe of the Philoſophers Work, a noble <hi>Polonian</hi> not more famous for his learning then ſubtilty of wit (not named, whoſe name not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

                     <p n="12">12. Philoſophers do uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe themſelves more pithily in types and aenigmaticall figures (as by a mute kind of ſpeech) then by woprs; for example, <hi>Senior</hi>'s Table, the allegorical Pictures of <hi>Roſarius,</hi> the Schemes of <hi>Abraham Judaeus</hi> in <hi>Flamellus:</hi> of the later ſort, the rare Emblemes of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Michael Maiërus,</hi> wherein the myſteries of the Ancients are ſo fully opened, that as new Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives they can preſent antiquated truth, and remote from our age as near unto our eies, and perfectly to be ſeen by us.</p>

                     <p n="14">14. As for the Matter of their <note place="margin">Of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Stone.</note> hidden Stone, Philoſophers have writ diverſly; ſo that very many diſagreeing in Words, do never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe very well conſent in the Thing; nor doth their different ſpeech, argue the ſcience ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous or falſe, ſince the ſame thing may be expreſſed with many tongues, divers expreſſions, and a different character, and alſo one and many things may be ſpoken after a divers manner.</p>

The very ſame men have profeſſed that this clear Stone is made of one thing onely, ſometimes of two, otherwhiles of three, at other times of four, and of five; and thus though writing ſo variouſly upon the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, doe nevertheleſſe agree in ſenſe and meaning.</p>

In the Generation of Metals and Vegetables, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acknowledgeth a three-fold Fire; to wit, Celeſtiall, Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and Innate. The Firſt flowes from Sol as its Fountaine, into the Boſome of the Earth; it ſtirreth up Fumes or Mercuriall and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous vapours, of which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are created, and mixeth it
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169776:140"/> ſelfe amongſt them; it ſtirreth up fire, placed and ſnorting in the ſeeds of the Vegetables, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſparkles unto it (as Spurres) for vegetation, The Second lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the bowels of the Earth, by the Impulſe and action where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Subterraneous vapours are driven upwards through Pores and Pipes, and thruſt outwards from the Centre towards the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Earth, both for the compoſition of Metals, where the Earth ſwelleth up, as alſo for the production of Vegetables, by putrefying their ſeeds, by ſoftning and preparing them for generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The third of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Solar, is generated of a vappid ſmoak of Metals, and alſo infuſed with the monthly proviſion grows together with the humid matter, &amp; is retained as in a Priſon within the ſtrength of it; or more true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as forme is conjoyned with the

In the generation of Animals, Celeſtiall Fire doth inſenſibly cooperate with the Animall; for it is the firſt Agent in Nature: but the heat of the <hi>Femella</hi> anſwereth Terreſtriall heat, untill it putrefie the Seed, and prepare it: The Fire implanted in the Seed, Sol's ſon, diſpoſeth the matter, and being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed in formeth it.</p>

Philoſophers have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">Threefold Fire of the Stone.</note> a three-fold Fire in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their work, Naturall, not Naturall, againſt Nature. The Naturall they call the Fiery Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Spirit Innate, kept in the profundity of matter, and moſt

In every mixt body Naturall Fire is the <note place="margin">Naturall.</note> Principle of Heat and Motion. Unnaturall Fire they name that <note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnaturall</note> which being called and coming extrinſecally, is introduced into the matter wonderfull artificially; that it may increaſe and multiply the ſtrength of naturall heat.

It is more credible never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, that the corrupting Fire, called Fire againſt Nature, is not different from the Innate, but the firſt degree of it, for the order of nature requireth, that corruption precede generation: the fire therefore that is innate agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law of Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth both, by exciting both ſucceſſively in the matter: the firſt of corruption more gentle ſtirred up by feeble heat, for to mollifie and prepare the body: the other of generation more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, moved by a more vehement heat, for to animate and fully informe the Elementary body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169776:142"/> by the former.

                     <p>Our <hi>Hermes</hi> was an Heathen, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, yet ſuch an Heathen as knew the power and greatneſſe of God, by other creatures and alſo by himſelfe, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God, as God: I ſhal not ſpare to ad, that he far excelled in godlineſſe moſt Chriſtians now a dayes in name onely; and gave immortall thanks unto him as the Fountaine of all good things, with a deep ſubmiſſion of mind for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits received. Hear I pray, yee ſonnes of Learning, whether God was as much converſant, and wrought as equally in the Heathen Nation, as amongſt his own people, when he ſaith: <hi>From the riſing</hi>

                     <p>Rub up your memory, I intreat you, and ſpeake plainly; were not the <hi>Magi</hi> Heathens, which came from the Eaſt by the guidance of a Star, that they might worſhhip Chriſt, whom nevertheleſſe the unbeleeving people hanged upon a Tree. Laſtly conſider well I beſeech you, yee faithfull favourers of true Wiſedome onely; from what Fountaine other Heathens beſides <hi>Hermes</hi> have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Principles of their Learning. Weare and better weare out their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes with diligence, that yee may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them to refer their wiſdome not unto God, but to attribute it, as gotten by their owne Induſtry. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſt your eyes upon the beginning of the admirable Tractate having ſeven Chapters of your Father <hi>Hermes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Secret of the <hi>Phyſical Stone,</hi> and obſerve how holily he thinketh of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:169776:159"/> God the beſtower of this Secret Science: for <hi>Hermes</hi> ſaith: <hi>In ſo great an Age I have not ceaſed to try experiments, nor have I ſpared my Soul from labour: I had this Art and Science by the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Living God only, who hath vouchſafed to open it to me his ſervant. Tis true, he hath given power of judging to rational creatures, but hath not left unto any an occaſion of ſinning. But I, unleſſe I feared the day of Doom, or the ſouls damnation for the concealing of this Science; I would make known nothing of this Science, nor prophetize to any. But I have been willing to render to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full their due, as the Author of Faith hath been pleaſed to beſtow upon me.</hi> Thus <hi>Hermes:</hi> then which nothing could have ever bin ſaid more wiſe, or more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to Chriſtian Religion. And hence it is, that ſo many as are or have been of a more ſublime wit and manly judgement, have imbraced the Living Holy, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Philoſophy of <hi>Hermes,</hi> with all their Soul and Strength (rejecting that dead, prophane, and humane Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie of the <hi>Ethnicks)</hi> and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and illuſtrated it in divers of their Writings and Watchings.
